# Hackathon6
Semantic Search


# Inspiration
In the age of overwhelming movie choices, we aimed to create an application that makes exploring film data simpler and more intuitive. By leveraging the power of semantic search, MovieSeek allows users to find and discover movies based on natural language queries, making it easier to connect with the films they love.
# What it Does
MovieSeek allows users to:
Search movie datasets using natural language queries.
Explore movie data, including ratings, genres, and reviews, retrieving relevant information quickly.
Our initial demo uses Netflix/IMDB datasets for semantic search testing, providing a solid foundation for a movie-centric exploration tool.
# How We Built It
Front-end: Built using Streamlit, offering a clean and user-friendly interface.
Back-end: Python code handles data retrieval and the semantic search functionality.
Data: Utilized Netflix/IMDB datasets for semantic search testing and movie analysis.
Collaboration was facilitated through Codespaces, enabling real-time coding and communication.
# Challenges We Ran Into
Team Organization: Initial hurdles in time management and team coordination.
Tech Stack: As first-time users of semantic search, we had to rapidly learn and adapt our approach.
# External Issues: Faced setbacks due to external factors but regained focus after attending a workshop on RAG AI (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
Time Constraints: Balancing data integration and frontend development under tight deadlines proved challenging.
# Accomplishments We're Proud Of
Successfully implemented semantic search using Netflix and IMDB datasets.
Developed a Streamlit-based frontend for easy demonstration and user interaction.
Overcame initial setbacks to deliver a functional project on time.
Promoted collaboration among team members with diverse academic backgrounds.
# What We Learned
Gained insights into integrating semantic search with diverse datasets to create a user-friendly application.
Improved our skills with Streamlit, enhancing our capability to build effective frontends quickly.
Acquired valuable experience in project management and rapid development under pressure.
# What's Next
Expand the dataset to include more comprehensive movie data, focusing on user preferences and trends.
Enhance the semantic search algorithms for more nuanced and specific movie-related queries.
Broaden frontend functionalities, transitioning towards a more dynamic full-stack web application.
Incorporate data visualization tools to better interpret search results and provide deeper insights.
